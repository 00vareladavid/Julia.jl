# LOGGING
* Logging.jl :: [The Logging module](https://github.com/kmsquire/Logging.jl)
* Lumberjack.jl :: A [logging library by Westley Hennigh](https://github.com/forio/Lumberjack.jl).
* Stage.jl :: has [stage macros, checkpoints and loggers](https://github.com/saltpork/Stage.jl) for Julia.


# SANDBOX
* JDock :: [An IJulia sandboxed by Docker containers](https://github.com/amitmurthy/JDock)


# UNITTEST 
* Coverage.jl :: [Take the Julia test coverage results and bundle them up in JSON](https://github.com/IainNZ/Coverage.jl) - it process a .jl file and its matching .cov file, tracking your Julia packages for test coverage and works with Coveralls, which integrates with TravisCI.
* FactCheck.jl :: Midje-like [testing framework](https://github.com/zachallaun/FactCheck.jl) written for Julia.
* Fixtures.jl :: provides [fixtures, mocks, matchers and patching to improve your tests](https://github.com/burrowsa/Fixtures.jl) with Julia.
* Jig.jl :: [Testing framework](https://github.com/milktrader/Jig.jl) for Julia.
* JulieTest.jl :: [A Julia testing framework inspired by javascript's Mocha](https://github.com/arypurnomoz/JulieTest.jl). See the [Wiki](https://github.com/arypurnomoz/JulieTest.jl/wiki)
* PackageTesting.jl :: [A standard for testing Julia packages](https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/PackageTesting.jl)
* RunTests.jl :: [A test running framework](https://github.com/burrowsa/RunTests.jl) for Julia that extends Base.Test
* Saute.jl :: [is another testing framework for Julia](https://github.com/milktrader/Saute.jl)
* testfast.jl :: [Automatically finds test files and runs them](https://github.com/Veraticus/testfast.jl)
* UnitTest.jl :: [Another unit-testing library for Julia](https://github.com/analyzere/UnitTest.jl), that provides nose test style output to the command line and is capable of producing an junit compatible xml result file.
