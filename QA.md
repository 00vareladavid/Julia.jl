Quality-Analysis(QA), CI, Test-Driven-Development (TDD), Behaviour-Driven-Development (BDD) and anything Testing related goes here:

## Packaging
* A [Julep for package requirements and quality standards](https://gist.github.com/IainNZ/6086173)
* The [Julia package evaluator](https://github.com/IainNZ/PackageEvaluator.jl) and the [results](http://iaindunning.com/PackageEval/)

## Profiling
Profile your code
* [IProfile](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/stdlib/profile/) in Base, to profile your code.

## CI
* Merge your Julia code with mainline to test it on a [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaLang/) build server.
