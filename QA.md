# UNITTEST 
- [Coverage.jl](https://github.com/IainNZ/Coverage.jl) :: [Take the Julia test coverage results and bundle them up in JSON - it process a .jl file and its matching .cov file, tracking your Julia packages for test coverage and works with Coveralls, which integrates with TravisCI.
- [FactCheck.jl](https://github.com/zachallaun/FactCheck.jl) :: Midje-like testing framework written for Julia.
- [Fixtures.jl](https://github.com/burrowsa/Fixtures.jl) :: provides fixtures, mocks, matchers and patching to improve your tests with Julia.
- [Jig.jl](https://github.com/milktrader/Jig.jl) :: Testing framework for Julia.
- [JulieTest.jl](https://github.com/arypurnomoz/JulieTest.jl) :: A Julia testing framework inspired by javascript's Mocha. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/arypurnomoz/JulieTest.jl/wiki)
- [PackageTesting.jl](https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/PackageTesting.jl) :: A standard for testing Julia packages.
- [RunTests.jl](https://github.com/burrowsa/RunTests.jl) :: A test running framework for Julia that extends Base.Test
- [Saute.jl](https://github.com/milktrader/Saute.jl) :: is another testing framework for Julia.
- [testfast.jl](https://github.com/Veraticus/testfast.jl) :: Automatically finds test files and runs them.
- [UnitTest.jl](https://github.com/analyzere/UnitTest.jl) :: Another unit-testing library for Julia, that provides nose test style output to the command line and is capable of producing an junit compatible xml result file.
