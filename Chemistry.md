## Chemistry 
* ChemicalKinetics.jl :: [Simulation, Bayesian inference and Bayesian model selection for chemical kinetics](https://github.com/scidom/ChemicalKinetics.jl) in Julia.
* Gillespie.jl :: [Stochastic Gillespie-type simulations using Julia](https://github.com/sdwfrost/Gillespie.jl)
* MethylUtils.jl :: [Utilities for bisulfite sequencing data](https://github.com/nw11/MethylUtils.jl)
* Qlab.jl :: is a [data manipulation and analysis tool based on the Savitzkyâ€“Golay filter](https://github.com/blakejohnson/Qlab.jl) - a digital filter that can be applied to a set of digital data points for the purpose of smoothing the data to increase the signal-to-noise ratio without greatly distorting the signal. Savitzky and Golay's paper is one of the most widely cited papers in the "Analytical Chemistry" journal.
* Synchrony.jl :: [Coherence/phase-locking statistics](https://github.com/simonster/Synchrony.jl) in Julia.

## Quantum Chemistry
* Cliffords.jl :: This library allows for [efficient calculation of Clifford circuits](https://github.com/BBN-Q/Cliffords.jl) by tracking the evolution of X and Z generators (the so-called tableau representation). Ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra
* pyquante2 :: PyQuante is a Quantum Chemistry suite written in Python, with [Julia support](https://github.com/rpmuller/pyquante2/) for HF and methods for integrals. {ToDo: expand the functionality RSN.}
* QSimulator.jl :: [Unitary and Lindbladian evolution of quantum states in Julia](https://github.com/BBN-Q/QSimulator.jl)


# YAJO
* [JuliaQuantum](http://juliaquantum.github.io/), is the umbrella Org for Quantum chemistry, Lindblad dynamics, Quantum tensor network, information and computation, etc...
