## Chemistry 
- [ChemicalKinetics.jl](https://github.com/scidom/ChemicalKinetics.jl) :: Simulation, Bayesian inference and Bayesian model selection for chemical kinetics in Julia.
- [Gillespie.jl](https://github.com/sdwfrost/Gillespie.jl) :: Stochastic Gillespie-type simulations using Julia.
- [MethylUtils.jl](https://github.com/nw11/MethylUtils.jl) :: Utilities for bisulfite sequencing data.
- [Qlab.jl](https://github.com/blakejohnson/Qlab.jl) :: is a data manipulation and analysis tool based on the Savitzkyâ€“Golay filter - a digital filter that can be applied to a set of digital data points for the purpose of smoothing the data to increase the signal-to-noise ratio without greatly distorting the signal. Savitzky and Golay's paper is one of the most widely cited papers in the "Analytical Chemistry" journal.
- [Synchrony.jl](https://github.com/simonster/Synchrony.jl) :: Coherence/phase-locking statistics in Julia.

## Quantum Chemistry
- [Cliffords.jl](https://github.com/BBN-Q/Cliffords.jl) :: This library allows for efficient calculation of Clifford circuits by tracking the evolution of X and Z generators (the so-called tableau representation). Ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra
- [pyquante2](https://github.com/rpmuller/pyquante2/) :: PyQuante is a Quantum Chemistry suite written in Python, with Julia support for HF and methods for integrals.
