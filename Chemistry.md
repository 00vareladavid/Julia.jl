* Qlab.jl :: is a [data manipulation and analysis tool based on the Savitzkyâ€“Golay filter](https://github.com/blakejohnson/Qlab.jl) - a digital filter that can be applied to a set of digital data points for the purpose of smoothing the data to increase the signal-to-noise ratio without greatly distorting the signal. Savitzky and Golay's paper is one of the most widely cited papers in the "Analytical Chemistry" journal.
