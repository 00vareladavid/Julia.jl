= BENCHMARKS =
* [http://speed.julialang.org Microbenchmark timings are on speed.julialang.org]
    ** [http://speed.julialang.org/timeline/ Timeline]
* [https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/test/perf/kernel/raytracer.jl Raytracer in the Julia kernel]

=== Logging ===
* Lumberjack.jl:: A [https://github.com/forio/Lumberjack.jl logging library] for Julia, by Westley Hennigh.

=== Optimization === 
* [http://juliaopt.org/ JuliaOpt] is an umbrella group for Julia-based optimization-related projects.
* [https://github.com/Staross/JuliaCMAES CMA-ES port] - a mix of the original minimal matlab implementation (purecmaes.m) and the full one (cmaes.m).
* [https://github.com/robertfeldt/BlackBoxOptim.jl BlackBoxOptim.jl] is a (experimental, work-in-progress) global optimization framework for Julia, supporting both multi- and single-objective optimization problems, focused on (meta-)heuristic/stochastic algorithms (DE, PSO, CMA-ES etc).

=== Profiling ===
Profile your code
* Use [http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/stdlib/profile/ IProfile] in Base to profile your code.

=== Sandbox === 
* [https://github.com/amitmurthy/JDock An IJulia sandboxed by Docker containers].


= TESTING =
=== UnitTest ===
* Fixtures.jl :: provides [https://github.com/burrowsa/Fixtures.jl fixtures, mocks, matchers and patching to improve your tests] with Julia.
