**NB:** As a new language in the scientific computing scene, new libraries are constantly being added, so there will be frequent changes and page reordering. The *Julya* repo only provides a list (of links) of Julia packages out in the wild, its not an endorsment of the software quality/ features, etc.. For Base packages, check if the package you seek is listed in the [built-in package manager on github](https://github.com/JuliaLang/METADATA.jl) or check the [metadata for registered Julia packages](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/packages/packagelist/)

Join the [http://julialang.org/community/](mailing list) or head over to [#julia on irc.freenode.net](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=julia) for a live chat.


### Contributing
Some tips for submitting a [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/pulls):
* Add your link as per the topic, with notes (if any) to the respective MarkDown (.md) pages in the repo.
* For broken links submit a bug report, or replace the broken URI, then submit a PR.
* For Documentation and cookbooks, check if it matches the categories listed, if yes, then list it against *DOC*, else use the Cookbook.md page.
