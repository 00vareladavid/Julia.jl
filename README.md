### Contributing
Some tips for submitting a [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/svaksha/julya/pulls):
* Add your link as per the topic, with notes (if any) to the respective (.md) pages in the repo.
* For broken links submit a bug report, or replace the broken URI, then submit a PR.
* For Documentation and cookbooks, check if it matches the categories listed, if yes, then list it against *DOC*, else use the Cookbook.md page.

**NB** :: As a new language in the scientific computing scene, new libraries are constantly being added, so there will be frequent changes and page reordering.
