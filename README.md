# INDEX
For Base packages, check if the package you seek is listed in their [built-in package manager](https://github.com/JuliaLang/METADATA.jl) on github, or check the [metadata for registered Julia packages](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/packages/packagelist/), else use the built-in package manager to install it after checking the requirements for versions.

**NB:** As a new language in the scientific computing scene, new libraries are constantly being added resulting in frequent changes and page reordering. The **Julia.jl** repo only provides a list (of links) of Julia packages out in the wild, not to be considered an endorsment of the software quality/ features, etc..

## Contributing Guidelines
##### To submit a [PR](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/pulls)
- Add your link as per the topic, in _alphabetical order_, with notes (if any) to the respective section in the markdown files.
- For broken links or outdated information, submit a bug report, or make the necessary changes and submit a PR.
- For Documentation and cookbooks, check if it matches the categories listed, else, list it on the [Resources.md](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/blob/master/Resources.md) page.
- For those unable to use git, create a github account, fork the 'Julia.jl' repo and edit the page by [clicking on the "pencil" icon on the markdown page](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository), then click on save and submit a PR. Github does this [automatically in 8 steps](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository).
