Here are some guidelines and tips on how to submit a Bug Report (BR) and/or [PR](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/pulls):\r\n\r\n## Guidelines\r\nThe Julia community has [ethical guidelines](http://julialang.org/community/standards/) aimed at respecting Copyright, Licenses and attribution standards<sup>{1} and {2}</sup> which you are requested to follow while submitting materials to be listed. Additionally, if you find any material (or code repos) that violates these ethical standards, please file a bug report for their removal from `Julia.jl`.\r\n+ References :\r\n   + {1} https://github.com/JuliaLang/julialang.github.com/issues/200\r\n   + {2} https://github.com/JuliaLang/julialang.github.com/issues/194\r\n\r\n\r\n## Status\r\nThese [comments](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/commit/a884fe9e921d57b87d85e970c2f57b8f21025641#commitcomment-15802037) led to a [BR discussing](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/issues/55) the addition of metadata tags that will enable programmers and package users to easily distinguish the status of various Julia packages that are under various stages of development. Currently, METADATA has a tag system but not all package authors use it, making it harder for lay users to know if the package maintenance is active or not. \r\n\r\nLets experiment with asking package authors and core-commiters to tag their Julia packages on the following criteria : \r\n\r\nOn a scale of 1 to 5 (1=lowest,..5=highest), please rank your package for,\r\n\r\n+ `Usability` : Does the package do what it says it does? is it easy to figure out? Is the package production-ready and actively maintained (issues/PRs are responded and resolved in a timely manner, and maintenance and testing is at par with Julia release cycles).\r\n+ `Quality` : Does the package have tests? are there lots of bugs? Do you have good documentation? Can it be used in production environments that expect prompt security patches?\r\n+ `Activity` : Should a 3rd party user bother to use your library, or is it really only intended to be used by the package author? Let's say, an experimental \"throw-away toy repo\" whose development has now been abandoned.\r\n+ `License` : Which software license do you use? If you dont have a license, please state `None`. \r\n\r\n## BugReport-PullRequest\r\n1. Add your link as per the top-level Category page within the topic sub-section(s), in _alphabetical order_, with notes (if any) in the markdown files.\r\n2. For broken links or outdated information, submit a bug report (BR), or make the necessary changes and submit a PR. Both are welcome. Please submit separate PR's for each link or change added.\r\n3. For Documentation and cookbooks, check if it matches the categories listed, else, list it on the [Resources.md](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/blob/master/Resources.md) page.\r\n4. For those unable to use git, create a github account, then fork the `Julia.jl` repo on the user interface. Then edit the page by [clicking on the \"pencil\" icon on the markdown page](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository), then click on save and submit a PR. Github does this [automatically in 8 steps](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository).\r\n",
