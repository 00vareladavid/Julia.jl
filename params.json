Additionally, if you find any material (or code repos) that violates these ethical standards, please file a bug report for their removal from `Julia.jl`.\r\n+ References :\r\n   + https://github.com/JuliaLang/julialang.github.com/issues/200\r\n   + https://github.com/JuliaLang/julialang.github.com/issues/194\r\n\r\n## BugReport-PullRequest\r\n1. Add your link as per the top-level Category page within the topic sub-section(s), in _alphabetical order_, with notes (if any) in the markdown files.\r\n2. For broken links or outdated information, submit a bug report (BR), or make the necessary changes and submit a PR. Both are welcome. Please submit separate PR's for each link or change added.\r\n3. For Documentation and cookbooks, check if it matches the categories listed, else, list it on the [Resources.md](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl/blob/master/Resources.md) page.\r\n4. For those unable to use git, create a github account, then fork the `Julia.jl` repo on the user interface. Then edit the page by [clicking on the \"pencil\" icon on the markdown page](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository), then click on save and submit a PR. Github does this [automatically in 8 steps](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
