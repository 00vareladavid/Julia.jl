# PACKAGES
**NOTE**: This is a list of Julia language packages that automate the loading process for specific datasets. To use the datasets you may use these packages or write your own Julia package or modify existing ones.
- [CommonCrawl.jl](https://github.com/tanmaykm/CommonCrawl.jl) :: Interface to common crawl dataset on Amazon S3.
- [PublicSuffix.jl](https://github.com/tanmaykm/PublicSuffix.jl) :: Julia Interface for working with the Public Suffix List at http://publicsuffix.org/.
- [RDatasets.jl](https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/RDatasets.jl) :: Julia package for loading many of the data sets available in R.
- [Socrata.jl](https://github.com/drewgendreau/Socrata.jl) :: An API wrapper for accessing the [Socrata Open Data API](http://dev.socrata.com) and importing data into a DataFrame. Socrata is an open data platform used by many local and State governments as well as by the Federal Government in USA. 
- [UCIMLRepo.jl](https://github.com/siddhantjain/UCIMLRepo.jl) :: A small package to allow for easy access and download of datasets from UCI ML repository.
- [WorldBankData.jl](https://github.com/4gh/WorldBankData.jl) :: The World Bank provides free access to data about development at data.worldbank.org.

# Genome
* [Saccharomyces Genome Database](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Saccharomyces_Genome_Database)
* [Genome Project Database](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?DB=genomeprj)
* [RefSeqGene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/rsg/) defines genomic sequences to be used as reference standards for well-characterized genes and is part of the Locus Reference Genomic (LRG) Project.
* The [3000 Rice Genomes Project Data](http://dx.doi.org/10.5524/200001), GigaScience Database and [Journal](http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/content/3/1/8) and [blog article in BMC](See also: http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/gigablog/2014/05/29/publish-data-fight-world-hunger/).
* NCBI's [Sequence Read Archive (SRA)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra)
* [DataLad](http://datalad.org) :: aims to provide access to scientific data available from various sources (e.g. lab or consortium web-sites such as Human connectome; data sharing portals such as OpenFMRI and CRCNS) through a single convenient interface and integrated with your software package managers (such as APT in Debian). Although initially targeting neuroimaging and neuroscience data in general, it will not be limited by the domain and a wide range of contributions are welcome. Get the [source code](https://github.com/datalad) on github.
